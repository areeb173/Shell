# Simple Shell

## Overview
The **Simple Shell** is a basic command-line interpreter built in C that mimics the behavior of a Unix shell. It reads commands from the user, executes them, and displays the output. The project is a learning tool for understanding Unix system programming, process creation, and system calls.

## Features
- Supports basic Unix commands (e.g., `ls`, `pwd`, `cat`, `echo`)
- Executes commands with arguments
- Handles file redirection (input/output)
- Implements built-in commands (e.g., `cd`, `exit`)
